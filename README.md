- The USA generated the highest regional viewership at 14.09%, with Brazil (13.15%) and the UK (12.98%) following closely, whereas Japan had the lowest at 11.47%, reflecting a stronger engagement footprint in North and South America and suggesting these regions are more receptive or saturated with content.

- Among hashtags, #Fitness ranked highest in views at 21.54%, followed by #Education (20.54%) and #Music (19.58%), revealing that audiences are especially drawn to health, learning, and entertainment-related content, which continues to perform well across platforms.

- YouTube led in platform views with 27.03%, followed by TikTok (25.41%) and Twitter (24.20%), showing that platforms known for video and virality are central to audience engagement and should remain top focus areas in strategy.
